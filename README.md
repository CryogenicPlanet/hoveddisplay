## Install

### CLI

TODO

### Raycast

For right now, just clone this repo and import it as an extension in raycast. I will publish this to the raycast extension repo at some point

## Acknowledgment

This was heavily insipired by https://github.com/jakehilborn/displayplacer and was a starting guide for building this, the main difference is that this automatically sets your origins so you can just choose which is your main display.
